Am severly time limited, as I have a vacation coming up :).  Did this in around 2.5 hours.  

Totally ignored testing, I knew I would'nt have the time or willpower to get to it today.  So sorry, most of your tests fail.

Added `node_modules` & `build folders` to `.gitignore`.

This was an enjoyable, and in my opinion, a good test for frontend developers.  Thanks for your time.
